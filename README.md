# Landing Page Project 

This project is a **single landing page** built during my internship at **Payam Pardaze** within the **Sanita Team**. The goal was to gain hands-on experience in **modern front-end development**, UI design, and building interactive web pages using React & Vite.

The landing page was developed using **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Material UI**, with **ThemeProvider** for consistent theming across components. **React Query** was used for efficient data management, while **Swiper.js** and **AOS** were implemented for interactive sliders and scroll animations.
